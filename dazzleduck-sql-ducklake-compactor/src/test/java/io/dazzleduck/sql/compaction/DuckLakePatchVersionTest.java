                  1. Rebuild the patch: rebase/re-cherry-pick the backport branch in \
                     dazzleduck-web/ducklake onto the new DuckDB-pinned ducklake commit, update its \
                     .github/duckdb-version, and dispatch build-and-publish-extension.yml with a new \
                     release_tag.
                  2. Update this module's pom.xml: ducklake.patch.release, \
                     ducklake.extension.cache.version, and ducklake.patch.built.for.duckdb.version.
                See DUCKLAKE_PATCH.md for the full procedure.
