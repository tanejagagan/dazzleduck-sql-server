# DazzleDuck DuckLake Compaction Service

A background service that runs minor and major compaction on DuckLake catalogs to keep Parquet file counts manageable and reclaim storage from expired snapshots.

## Overview

DuckLake writes small Parquet files on each insert/update. Without compaction, query performance
degrades as the file count grows. This service compacts files via any number of configurable
**tiers**, each a self-contained compaction level: its own file-size range, schedule, file-count
cap, enable flag, and DuckDB connection settings. The bundled default is two tiers, "minor" and
"major", matching what used to be hardcoded:

- **minor** — merges adjacent small files below `8MB`. Runs frequently (every 1 minute).
- **major** — merges files in `[8MB, 64MB)`. Runs less frequently (every 1 hour).

There's nothing special about having exactly two — add, remove, rename, or resize tiers freely, as
long as every **enabled** tier's `[min_file_size, max_file_size)` range is disjoint from every
other enabled tier's. That's enforced at startup (refuses to start on overlapping ranges or
duplicate tier names) and is what lets tiers run **concurrently with no locking between them**:
since each only ever touches files in its own range, two tiers can never race on the same file.

Every tier is scheduled at a **fixed rate**, not a fixed delay: a cycle that takes time `T` waits
`frequency - T` before the next one starts, rather than a full `frequency` after completion
regardless of `T`. A cycle that runs longer than its frequency has no negative wait — the next one
starts immediately.

## Configuration

All settings live under the `dazzleduck_sql_compaction` HOCON root in `application.conf` and can be overridden at runtime with `--conf key=value`.

| Key | Default | Description |
|-----|---------|-------------|
| `databases` | `[]` | DuckLake catalog names to compact (must be attached via startup script) |
| `compaction_tiers` | see below | Compaction tiers, keyed by tier name (see below) |
| `housekeeping_frequency` | `5 minutes` | How often to expire snapshots and delete orphaned files |
| `housekeeping_connection_settings` | `[]` | Raw SQL run on housekeeping's connection right after opening it — independent of any tier |
| `snapshot_retention` | `15 minutes` | Expire snapshots older than this during housekeeping |
| `rewrite_deletes_enabled` | `true` | Each housekeeping cycle first runs `ducklake_rewrite_data_files`, rewriting data files with enough deleted rows so their delete files are dropped |
| `rewrite_delete_threshold` | unset | Fraction (0–1) of a file's rows that must be deleted before it is rewritten; unset uses the catalog's `rewrite_delete_threshold` option (DuckLake default 0.95) |
| `health_port` | `8080` | Port for the `GET /health` endpoint |
| `startup_script_provider` | — | How to load the startup SQL (attach catalogs, load extensions) |
| `config_provider` | — | Optional: overlay config values read from a table (see below) |

The bundled defaults live in this module's `application.conf` (not `reference.conf`).

### Compaction tiers

```hocon
compaction_tiers {
  minor {
    enabled = true
    frequency = 1 minute
    min_file_size = 0
    max_file_size = 8MB
    max_compacted_files = 1000   # 0 = unbounded
    connection_settings = ["SET memory_limit='2GB'", "SET threads=2"]
  }
  major {
    enabled = true
    frequency = 1 hour
    min_file_size = 8MB
    max_file_size = 64MB
    max_compacted_files = 1000
    connection_settings = ["SET memory_limit='8GB'", "SET threads=4"]
  }
}
```

Tiers are **keyed by name**, and the key is the tier's name — there is no `name` field. That is
what makes a tier individually overridable: HOCON merges objects field-by-field but replaces lists
wholesale, so

```bash
--conf 'dazzleduck_sql_compaction.compaction_tiers.minor.frequency = 10 seconds'
```

changes one cadence and leaves every other field of `minor` — and every other tier — intact. The
same spelling works from a `config_provider` table (see below). Tiers are always processed in
`min_file_size` order regardless of key order, so logs and the per-tier file-count gauges read in
band order.

A **list** of tiers, each carrying its own `name` field, is still accepted so configs written
against 0.2.19 keep working; with a list, declaration order is preserved.

> **Migrating from the list shape:** don't add a per-tier override until the file is keyed by name.
> Against a list, `compaction_tiers.minor.frequency` is an object that *replaces* the whole list
> rather than merging into it, leaving one tier holding only the overridden field — startup then
> fails naming the incomplete tier and pointing back here.

Per-tier fields:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Set `false` to turn this tier off entirely, for all databases, without removing it from config |
| `frequency` | How often this tier runs |
| `min_file_size` / `max_file_size` | This tier only touches files in `[min_file_size, max_file_size)`. Always required, including `0` for the lowest tier |
| `max_compacted_files` | Caps files merged per cycle (passed through as `ducklake_merge_adjacent_files`'s own `max_compacted_files`); `0` = unbounded, and a catalog with more eligible files than the cap just finishes over several ticks instead of one |
| `connection_settings` | Optional (default none). Raw SQL run on this tier's own connection right after opening it, e.g. to set `memory_limit`/`threads` differently per tier. Optional because it is the tier's only list-valued field, and a key/value override table can carry only scalars — so a whole tier can be declared from such a table |

Disabling a tier (`enabled = false`) is the direct way to turn it off. Simply raising a tier's
`frequency` to a very large value is **not** equivalent — with the old hardcoded minor/major design
that could starve the other tier of any chance to run at all; with independent per-tier schedules
that's no longer true, but `enabled` is still the explicit way to say "don't run this."

### Connections

Each tier, plus housekeeping, gets its own **real, independent DuckDB connection** — not
`io.dazzleduck.sql.commons.ConnectionPool`, whose `getConnection()` returns duplicates of one shared
process-wide instance. That matters because DuckDB's `memory_limit`, `threads`, and
`temp_directory` are all **GLOBAL**-scoped (confirmed via `duckdb_settings()`): a `SET` on one
duplicate silently changes it for every other duplicate of the same instance, which would make two
concurrently-running tiers with different `connection_settings` race and clobber each other's
global config instead of each getting its own value. Each connection independently re-runs the
startup script before applying its own `connection_settings`, so the script must be safe to run
more than once (plain `ATTACH`/`INSTALL`/`LOAD` are; one-time DDL like `CREATE TABLE` is not).

**This means a local file-based DuckLake catalog (`ATTACH 'ducklake:/path/...'`) cannot have more
than one tier enabled at a time** (nor a tier running alongside housekeeping) — DuckDB only allows
one attach of a given local catalog file at a time (`Unique file handle conflict`, verified
empirically), and separate raw connections trying to attach the same file concurrently will hit
that error as soon as more than one is opened. Server-backed catalogs (Postgres) have no such
restriction and are what any real multi-tier deployment wanting per-tier connection isolation
should use.

### Startup Script

Configure under `startup_script_provider`:

```hocon
dazzleduck_sql_compaction.startup_script_provider {
  script_location = "/config/startup.sql"
}
```

Or pass inline content:

```hocon
dazzleduck_sql_compaction.startup_script_provider {
  content = "ATTACH 'ducklake:...' AS mydb (DATA_PATH 's3://...');"
}
```

The startup script runs before configuration overrides are read, so catalogs referenced by the
config-provider table must be attached here.

### Configuration Overrides from a Table

Settings can be overlaid from a two-column key/value table (readable after the startup script
has attached its catalog):

```hocon
dazzleduck_sql_compaction.config_provider {
  table = "mydb.main.compactor_config"
  # key_column   = "config_key"   (default)
  # value_column = "value"        (default)
  # prefix       = ""             (optional key prefix filter)
}
```

Only scalar keys can be overridden this way, because every table value is read as a string and
HOCON will not widen a string to a list. That still rules out `databases` and
`housekeeping_connection_settings`, but **individual tier fields are scalars and can be set**, since
tiers are keyed by name rather than listed:

| Row key | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| `compaction_tiers.minor.frequency` | retunes one cadence; the tier's other fields are untouched |
| `compaction_tiers.minor.enabled` | turns one tier off while leaving it configured, so its file-count gauge still reports its band |
| `compaction_tiers.mega.min_file_size` (+ the other scalars) | declares a whole new tier — `connection_settings` is optional precisely so this is possible |

A tier's `connection_settings` is still a list and so cannot be set from the table; it stays in the
file. Note also that overrides are read **once at startup**, so a changed row takes effect on the
next restart — this centralizes the values, it does not make them live.

A configured table that cannot be read is a fatal startup error by design — silently falling
back to file defaults would hide a broken override source.

## Health Check

`GET /health` on `health_port` (default 8080) returns uptime plus per-database stats, with one
nested object per configured tier (`totalCompactions`, `currentFiles`, `nextExecutionTime`) plus
whole-catalog totals (`totalFailedCycles`, `totalFilesCompacted`, `totalFilesRewritten`, `lastSuccessTime`,
`currentTotalFiles`). Note: the status is always `UP` while the process is running — it does not
reflect failing compaction cycles.

```

## Telemetry

The service can ship both its meters and its log lines to the DazzleDuck OTel collector over OTLP
gRPC. Both exports are off by default and independent of each other: either can be on without the
other. Both are configured in the file or via environment variables only; the config-provider
table overrides described above do not apply to them.

### Two tokens, two queues

The collector routes every export by the token's `x-dd-ingestion-queue` claim, regardless of
signal, and its log and metric queues have different schemas. So the two exports need **two
different tokens**: one whose claim names a metrics queue and one whose claim names a logs queue.
Mint each with the login endpoint, passing the queue in the `claims` map (see the root README's
"Ingestion Queue Routing" section), and configure the collector's `ingestion_queue_table_mapping` with
one entry per queue. Using the same token for both is refused at startup.

| Variable | Config key | Default |
|----------|------------|---------|
| `DD_METRICS_ENABLED` | `metrics.enabled` | `false` |
| `DD_METRICS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `metrics.endpoint` | `http://localhost:4317` (the collector's gRPC port, not its health port) |
| `DD_METRICS_OTLP_TOKEN` | `metrics.token` | none; required when metrics are enabled |
| `DD_LOGS_ENABLED` | `logs.enabled` | `false` |
| `DD_LOGS_OTLP_ENDPOINT` | `logs.endpoint` | the metrics endpoint |
| `DD_LOGS_OTLP_TOKEN` | `logs.token` | none; required when logs are enabled |
| `DD_LOGS_LEVEL` | `logs.level` | `INFO` |

`metrics.service_name` (default `ducklake-compactor`) is reported as the `service.name` resource
attribute on both signals. An enabled export with no token is a fatal startup error, since the
collector would reject every request and the signal would silently never land.

```bash
docker run \
  -e DD_METRICS_ENABLED=true -e DD_METRICS_OTLP_TOKEN=... \
  -e DD_LOGS_ENABLED=true -e DD_LOGS_OTLP_TOKEN=... \
  -e DD_METRICS_OTLP_ENDPOINT=http://collector:4317 \
  dazzleduck/ducklake-compactor:latest \
  --conf 'dazzleduck_sql_compaction.databases=[mydb]'
```

### Logs

All code logs through SLF4J with Logback as the backend. With `logs.enabled = true` an
OpenTelemetry appender is attached to the root logger next to the console appender, so console
output is unchanged and every line at `logs.level` or above is also exported as an OTLP log
record. In the collector's log table the logger name lands in `scope_name`, the rendered message
in `body`, the level in `severity_text`, and a logged exception in the `exception.type`,
`exception.message` and `exception.stacktrace` attributes. The exporter batches records, so a
line shows up in the collector within a few seconds; shutdown flushes whatever is still queued.

Things worth knowing:

- With logs on and metrics off, the fallback logging meter registry prints every meter once a
  minute at INFO, and those lines are exported too. Enable metrics or set `DD_LOGS_LEVEL=WARN`.
- Log export is set up before the rest of startup, so a failure later in startup (bad startup
  script, unreadable config-provider table, port in use) is logged and flushed before the process
  exits and the reason a pod is crash-looping is in the log table. A failure in the export setup
  itself (missing token, bad level, unreachable collector) can only be read from the console.
- Credentials are masked in every exported record, in the body and in every string attribute
  including `exception.message` and `exception.stacktrace`. This matters because DuckDB repeats
  the startup script in its errors: a failed Postgres or DuckLake-on-Postgres `ATTACH` reports the
  whole connection string with its password, and a parser error quotes the statement. Every
  compaction connection re-runs the script, so these errors can recur on every cycle. Masked:
  quoted values of secret-like names (`SECRET`, `KEY_ID`, `SESSION_TOKEN`, `password`,
  `s3_secret_access_key`, ...), unquoted `password=...`-style and URL query values, `user:password@`
  in URIs, `Bearer` tokens, and parser echo lines (`LINE n: ...`) as a whole. Console output is not
  masked. Masking works on patterns, so keep credentials in those forms (or in DuckDB secrets
  created from environment variables) rather than in free text.

### Metrics

Micrometer metrics are emitted via the logging registry by default, and over OTLP when
`metrics.enabled = true`:

| Metric | Tags | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `ducklake.compaction.duration` | `type` (tier name, or `housekeeping`), `step` (merge/rewrite_deletes/expire/cleanup), `database` | Time per compaction step |
| `ducklake.compaction.cycles` | `tier`, `database` | Successful compaction cycles for this tier |
| `ducklake.compaction.failures` | `type` (tier name, or `housekeeping`), `database` | Cycles that ended in an exception |
| `ducklake.files.compacted` | `database` | Total files compacted, across all tiers |
| `ducklake.files.rewritten` | `database` | Total data files rewritten by housekeeping to drop their delete files (`rewrite_deletes` step) |
| `ducklake.files.total` | `database` | Total active Parquet files |
| `ducklake.files.by_tier` | `tier`, `database` | Active files in this tier's file-size range |
