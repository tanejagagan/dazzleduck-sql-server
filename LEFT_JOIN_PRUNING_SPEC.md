# Unused LEFT JOIN Elimination — Design Specification

## Overview

Given an **outer query that selects from a view**, rewrite it so that
`LEFT JOIN`s inside the view whose columns the outer query never references are
removed — producing a semantically equivalent but cheaper query.

Two chained optimizations run: **projection pushdown** (the outer query prunes
the view's `SELECT` list) followed by **join elimination** (a table that then
contributes no referenced column is dropped).

**Status:** specification + scaffolded failing tests. Implementation is a no-op
stub (`Transformations.pruneUnusedLeftJoins`) pending the work described here.

---

## Worked Example

```sql
-- view
CREATE VIEW fv AS
SELECT f.*, a.a_name, b.b_name
FROM   f
LEFT JOIN a ON f.a_id = a.a_id
LEFT JOIN b ON f.b_id = b.b_id;

-- outer query (input)
SELECT f_col, a_name FROM fv WHERE f_col > 10;

-- output
SELECT f_col, a_name
FROM (
  SELECT f.*, a.a_name          -- b_name projection dropped (projection pushdown)
  FROM   f
  LEFT JOIN a ON f.a_id = a.a_id -- LEFT JOIN b eliminated (join elimination)
) AS fv
WHERE f_col > 10;
```

`F` is the fact table (preserved, left side). `A` and `B` are dimension tables.
Because only `a_name` is used, the join to `B` is dead and is removed.

## API

```java
/**
 * Prune LEFT JOINs from an inlined view whose columns the outer query never references.
 * Optimization only — returns the outer AST structurally unchanged on any uncertainty.
 *
 * @param outerSqlAst parsed outer query (a statement wrapper) selecting from the view
 * @param viewBodyAst parsed view body (the F/A/B join SELECT) — the caller fetched and parsed it
 * @return rewritten outer AST with the view inlined as a pruned subquery, or outerSqlAst unchanged
 */
public static JsonNode pruneUnusedLeftJoins(JsonNode outerSqlAst, JsonNode viewBodyAst)
```

- **AST in, AST out** (`JsonNode`). The caller owns `parseToTree` / `parseToSql`;
  this function never touches SQL strings and takes no DuckDB connection.
- **Which base table is the view?** The caller passes no view name, so v1 relies
  on the precondition that the outer `FROM` contains **exactly one `BASE_TABLE`** —
  that reference is replaced by `viewBodyAst`.
- **No `conn` in v1.** The transform is pure AST. The deferred join-key uniqueness
  verification will need a `Connection`; it is intentionally left off the v1
  signature so no unused parameter is carried until then.
- **Contract shift:** because `viewBodyAst` is supplied directly, the function
  cannot confirm the single outer base table is actually a view — it trusts the
  caller that `viewBodyAst` is the body for that reference.

---

## Soundness Preconditions (per candidate LEFT JOIN)

A `JOIN` node is eliminable only when **all** of these hold:

1. `join_type == "LEFT"` and the candidate table is the **`right`** arm (the
   null-supplying side). The preserved `left` / fact side is never dropped.
2. The `right` arm is a **`BASE_TABLE`**. (v1 restriction; subquery / nested-join
   right arms are out of scope.)
3. **No column of the right arm is referenced** anywhere in the *retained* tree —
   the view's (pruned) `select_list`, `where_clause`, `group_expressions`,
   `having`, `qualify`, modifiers (ORDER BY / etc.), **and the `ON` conditions of
   joins that remain**.
4. The `ON` `condition` is an **equi-join** — `COMPARE_EQUAL`, or a
   `CONJUNCTION_AND` of them (`ref_type == REGULAR`, `using_columns` empty). This
   is a *shape* guard only.

### Trusted assumption (stated loudly)

Per the design decision, v1 **trusts** that each dimension table is unique on its
join key and performs **no** row-multiplication check. If a dimension is *not*
unique on the join key, a `LEFT JOIN` multiplies fact rows, and eliminating it
changes row count / aggregate results even though no dimension column is selected.
**This is the single biggest correctness caveat** and is documented on the API.

Scope decisions locked for v1:

| Decision | Choice |
|---|---|
| Row-multiplication safety | Trust join-key uniqueness (no verification) |
| Join types handled | `LEFT` only |
| Input / output | Outer query over a view; inline the view and prune |

## Algorithm

```
pruneUnusedLeftJoins(outerSqlAst, viewBodyAst):
  outer      = getFirstStatementNode(outerSqlAst)
  viewRef    = the single BASE_TABLE in outer FROM            // v1: exactly one
  if none    -> return outerSqlAst unchanged

  usedViewCols = column refs in outer qualified to viewRef (alias-aware)
  if bare STAR over the view -> return outerSqlAst unchanged   // all columns used

  body = deep-copy(getFirstStatementNode(viewBodyAst))         // never mutate caller's node

  (a) projection pushdown:
      prune body.select_list to entries whose output name in usedViewCols

  (b) join elimination to a fixpoint:
      repeat until no change:
        counts = one walk of the body counting references per table/alias
        for each JOIN node (bottom-up) meeting preconditions above,
            where every reference to the right arm comes from its own ON condition:
          replace the JOIN node with its `left` arm
      -- one count-walk per ROUND (not per candidate): O(rounds x body size),
      -- rounds bounded by the longest transitive elimination chain. Stale counts
      -- within a round only over-count, so a join is never wrongly freed.

  (c) re-inline:
      replace viewRef in outer with (serialized body) AS <viewRef alias/name>

  return outerSqlAst   // mutated copy; same JsonNode kind in and out
```

### Notes

- **Fixpoint (b) is required.** Dropping `B` removes the `f.b_id` / `A` references
  in its `ON` clause, which can make `A` droppable on the next round.
- **Column ownership.** Each `COLUMN_REF.column_names` is `["alias","col"]` or
  `["col"]`; resolve the qualifier against join-arm aliases / table names.
  **Self-joins** are disambiguated by alias, not table name.

## Fail-safe Rule

The transformation is an **optimization, never a semantic change**. On *any*
uncertainty it returns the input AST unchanged (degrading to a no-op — the
fail-closed discipline of commit #358, but non-throwing here). When nothing is
optimized, the **same instance** passed in is returned, so callers can detect a
no-op by reference identity. Explicit bail-outs:

- **Any STAR in the outer query** — bare (`*`) *or table-qualified* (`fv.*`,
  `v.*`): both expand to view columns that cannot be enumerated at the AST level.
- **Unqualified** column reference that cannot be attributed to a single arm.
- `USING(...)` join (null `condition`, populated `using_columns`).
- `right` arm not a base table; non-equi `ON` condition.
- More than one `BASE_TABLE` in the outer `FROM`.
- **Outer `FROM` resolves to a WITH-declared CTE** — a local CTE shadows any
  catalog view of the same name (`WITH fv AS (…) SELECT … FROM fv`), so the
  reference is the CTE, not the view; inlining the view body there would change
  results.

### Scope-aware variant — view referenced inside a CTE

`pruneUnusedLeftJoins(outerSqlAst, viewName, viewBodyAst)` extends the above to the
case where the view is referenced inside **CTE bodies** and/or at the outer top-level
`FROM`, e.g. `WITH a AS (SELECT a_name FROM fv) SELECT * FROM a`. Passing `viewName`
lets references be located by name. Every eligible reference is pruned
**independently within its own scope** — inlining is local and semantics-preserving,
so any subset of references may be optimized:

- **Top-level** — outer `FROM` is the view. Usage is collected from the outer SELECT
  scope **excluding CTE bodies** (a CTE cannot reference the outer `FROM`'s columns),
  so sibling CTE usage does not pollute top-level pruning.
- **CTE-nested** — the view is in the `FROM` of one or more CTE bodies. Column usage
  and the STAR check are evaluated **within each CTE body scope**, so an outer
  `SELECT *` *over the CTE* (which expands to CTE columns, not view columns) does not
  block the optimization. The pruned view body is inlined in place of the reference
  inside each CTE body; the CTE's own `SELECT` list is untouched.

A scope whose view columns cannot be enumerated (a bare or qualified STAR **in that
scope**) is skipped individually; other references are still pruned.

`viewName` may be **qualified** (`s2.fv`, `cat.s2.fv`); qualification must match the
reference at the same level. An unqualified name matches only unqualified references —
a qualified reference (`s2.fv`) may be a *different*, same-named view. A qualified name
matches only identically-qualified references — an unqualified reference resolves via
the search path, which is invisible at the AST level. Qualified references can never
resolve to a CTE, so qualified names skip the CTE-shadow bail below.

Additional bail-out for this variant: an **unqualified** view name rebound by a CTE
anywhere in the outer `WITH` (sibling/outer shadow) is a full no-op.

Additional conservative rules:

- **Projection pushdown is skipped** (join elimination still applies) when the
  view body has `DISTINCT`, `GROUP BY` / grouping sets, or any other modifier —
  under `DISTINCT` the select list *is* the dedup key, and positional references
  (`GROUP BY 1`, `ORDER BY 1`) would silently re-point if entries were dropped —
  and likewise when it has `GROUP BY ALL` (the grouping key is *derived from* the
  select list, and it serializes with EMPTY `group_expressions`;
  `aggregate_handling = FORCE_AGGREGATES` is the only marker), a `QUALIFY`
  (its own field, not a modifier; may reference a select-list alias), or a
  `HAVING` (alias references, and without GROUP BY it forces implicit
  aggregation).
- **Any nameable entry is droppable, not only `COLUMN_REF`s** — an aliased
  `CASE`/`CAST`/`FUNCTION`/`SUBQUERY` whose alias the outer query never uses is
  dropped too, so unused expressions stop being computed and stop contributing
  references to (b)'s counts (an unused lambda parameter, which reads as an
  unqualified column, no longer disables elimination for the whole view).
  `STAR` entries and unaliased expressions are always kept. One deliberate
  consequence: a correlated scalar subquery that would error at runtime (more
  than one row) no longer errors for callers who never projected its column —
  an error becomes a result, never a result a different result.
- **Implicit aggregation guard.** `SELECT 42 AS c, sum(x) AS s FROM t` is one
  row and serializes with NO marker at all (STANDARD_HANDLING, empty groups, no
  HAVING); dropping `s` would make it N rows. Aggregate-ness is a binder fact —
  at parse level `sum` and `+` are both just `FUNCTION` nodes — so the guard is
  structural: if nothing kept references a column (SUBQUERY subtrees excluded,
  their refs bind in their own scope), every kept entry may be a plain constant
  and nothing is dropped. A kept column reference proves a valid aggregated body
  stays aggregated, and a non-aggregated body's row count is
  projection-independent anyway.
- **Multi-part column references** (`s.field`) are ambiguous at parse time
  between `table.column` and `struct_column.field`; *every* part is recorded as
  a potentially-used column name so a struct column projected by the view is
  never pruned away (keeps too much, never too little).
- **Identifier comparisons fold case**, matching DuckDB's case-insensitive
  resolution (quoted identifiers included): used-column matching, join-qualifier
  counting, the CTE-shadow bail, and view-name location. Exact matching read a
  differently-cased-but-binding reference as unused — pruning the entry (a bind
  failure after inlining) or the join (eliminated out from under a still-bound
  qualified reference).

## AST Reference (DuckDB `json_serialize_sql`)

`LEFT JOIN` node shape (verified against DuckDB 1.x):

```json
{
  "type": "JOIN",
  "left":  { "type": "BASE_TABLE", "table_name": "f", ... },
  "right": { "type": "BASE_TABLE", "table_name": "b", ... },
  "condition": {
    "class": "COMPARISON", "type": "COMPARE_EQUAL",
    "left":  { "class": "COLUMN_REF", "column_names": ["f","b_id"] },
    "right": { "class": "COLUMN_REF", "column_names": ["b","b_id"] }
  },
  "join_type": "LEFT",
  "ref_type": "REGULAR",
  "using_columns": []
}
```

`left` / `right` are themselves FROM-nodes, so joins form a left-deep / nested
tree: `((F LJ A) LJ B)` — the outermost `JOIN` has `left = (F LJ A)`, `right = B`.
Dropping `B` replaces the outer node with its `left`. Dropping the middle `A`
requires recursing into the left arm and replacing `(F LJ A)` with `F`.

## Code Touch-points

| Concern | Reuse |
|---|---|
| First SELECT node | `Transformations.getFirstStatementNode` |
| Column refs | `Transformations.collectReferences`, `getReferenceName` |
| FROM/JOIN walk template | `collectAllTableRefsFromFromNode` JOIN case; `renameBaseTablesInFromNode` |
| New constants | add `join_type`, `ref_type`, `condition`, `using_columns` to `ExpressionConstants` (today raw literals / absent) |
| New logic | `Transformations.pruneUnusedLeftJoins` + JOIN-replace / wrap-as-subquery helpers alongside `injectFilterCtes` |

View-body fetching (`duckdb_views()`, SQL slicing) is **the caller's job** and is
not part of this function.

## Test Plan (JUnit 5, `dazzleduck-sql-commons`)

Scaffolded in `PruneUnusedLeftJoinsTest`:

- Only `a_name` used → `B` dropped, `A` kept (1 join remains).
- Both dims used → no change (2 joins).
- Neither dim used → both dropped (0 joins).
- Transitive: `A` referenced only by `B`'s `ON` clause; drop `B` → drop `A`
  (fixpoint). *(scaffold, `@Disabled` until implemented.)*
- Fail-safe: bare `*` over view; `USING` join; multi-table outer FROM → input
  returned unchanged.
- Round-trip equivalence: the pruned output re-parses and, on a seeded dataset
  containing a fact row with an **unmatched** dimension key, returns rows
  identical to the original outer query against the real view — the true
  equivalence check that `LEFT` semantics are preserved.

## Open Questions

1. **Output form** — inline the pruned view as a subquery (as shown), or emit a
   rewritten `CREATE VIEW`? Inline is self-contained; a rewritten view helps if
   reused.
2. **Scope of v1 input** — hard-require exactly one view in the outer FROM, or
   handle several?
3. **Actual view vs any subquery** — the same machinery works if the outer query
   already contains the join tree as an inline subquery (no catalog lookup).
   Cover that in v1, or view-reference only?
